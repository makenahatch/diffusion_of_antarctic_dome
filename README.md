This Python script simulates the diffusion of ice sheet thickness of an Antarctic dome, using
BEDMAP2 data to represent an ice dome in the Antarctic Peninsula region. It begins by importing
essential libraries and reading input data from an ASCII file. The script processes this file to
extract geographic grid information, including dimensions, resolution, and corner coordinates, and
establishes a 2-D grid for spatial calculations. Initial conditions, such as time variables and step
size, are then defined to simulate diffusion processes over the spatial grid, representing phenomena
like changes in ice thickness.

This tool offers scientists a powerful resource for modeling and visualizing diffusivity in the
Antarctic Peninsula region, aiding the study of ice dynamics and climate processes. By simulating ice
thickness evolution over time, it enhances our understanding of how ice properties respond to
environmental changes. Focused on a region critical to climate research, the script combines BEDMAP2
data with detailed geographic characteristics to enable precise regional analysis. The insights
gained support predictions of ice sheet behavior under shifting climates, contributing to our
understanding of Antarctica's impact on global sea-level rise and climate systems.
