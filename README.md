## Purpose
This script models the diffusion dynamics of an Antarctic dome using surface and bed topography data. The visualizations generated can be used to help scientists study ice sheet behavior and polar geography.

## Features
- Processes Antarctic topography data from ASC files
- Creates 2-D grids and visualizations
- Supports research on ice dynamics and climate change

## Inputs
1. **`bedmap_surface.asc`**: surface elevation data
2. **`bedmap_bed.asc`**: bedrock elevation data

## Outputs
- Grids of surface and bedrock elevations
- Plots of topography and diffusion patterns

## Applications
- Studying Antarctic ice dynamics
- Assessing climate impacts on sea levels
- Visualizing polar topography

## Limitations
- Requires correctly formatted ASC files
- Focuses on basic processing and visualization
